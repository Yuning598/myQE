:::{admonition} Definition (Weak stationarity)
$$
E[y_t]=\mu,\qquad \operatorname{Var}(y_t)=\sigma^2,\qquad \operatorname{Cov}(y_t,y_{t-s})=\gamma_s.
$$
These moments do not depend on calendar time $t$.

:::

Key intuition: weak stationarity makes historical dependence informative for future forecasting. In volatility models, we usually require the variance process to have finite unconditional moments.
