# Separation in Logit

:::{admonition} Definition (Perfect separation)
A binary response sample is perfectly separated if there exists $b$ such that
$$
X_i'b>0\text{ for all }Y_i=1,
\qquad
X_i'b<0\text{ for all }Y_i=0.
$$

:::

In logit, separation makes likelihood approach its supremum as $\|b\|\to\infty$. No finite MLE exists.
